Well, well, well...

Look who decided to click anyway üòè

You're exactly the type of person i write for - the rebellious, curious, "i-wonder-what-happens-if-i-click-this" type.

Here's the deal:

Currently building AI systems that can detect financial fraud faster than you can say "blockchain". When i'm not doing that, i'm probably at some hackathon at 3am fueled by energy drinks and questionable life choices.

Oh, and i'm also trying to figure out how to make n8n workflows that don't look like spaghetti code.

```python
# coming soon‚Ñ¢
def write_blog_posts():
    while procrastinating:
        learn_new_framework()
        question_life_choices()
        drink_more_coffee()
    return "eventually"
```

Coming soon‚Ñ¢:

| Topic | Priority |
|-------|----------|
| Deep dives into AI/ML that don't put you to sleep | High |
| Fintech war stories (the ones i'm legally allowed to tell) | Medium |
| Why vector databases are cooler than you think | High |
| Probably some rants about why everyone's building RAG systems wrong | Very High |
| Maybe some crypto hot takes (depending on how brave i'm feeling) | TBD |

In the meantime:

Go follow me on [twitter](https://x.com/kernelkook) where i share half-baked thoughts and argue with bots about transformer architectures.

Or don't. I'm not your boss.

PS: if you're a recruiter and you made it this far, you're hired. (not really, but you get points for persistence)

PPS: if you're my mom reading this, hi mom! yes, i'm eating vegetables. no, i don't need a girlfriend to "settle down"

Coming Soon‚Ñ¢ - because good things take time, and i'm a perfectionist with ADHD
